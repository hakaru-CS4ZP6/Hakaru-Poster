\normalsize{\textbf{Language Guide}}

\bigskip
\scriptsize{Hakaru is an experimental \textbf{probabilistic programming language}, which aims to simplify the implementation of statistical distributions. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Niche application means that Hakaru is a small language with limited features.
    \item Running a hakaru program generates a stream of random numbers distributed according the statistical distribution modeled.
    \item Hakaru code can be compiled to C and Haskell so that models can be exported for use in larger applications.
\end{itemize}

}

\bigskip
\scriptsize{{\tt \scriptsize{hk-maple}} is a provided inference algorithm that uses Maple to perform algebraic transformations on hakaru programs. In its default mode (Simplify), it returns an equivalent hakaru program with greater sampling efficiency. In applications requiring billions of samples (e.g. machine learning) this has the potential to save significant processing time!}

\normalsize{\textbf{Endeavours}}

\scriptsize{
\begin{itemize}
  \item Standard library development: the UDR is used to branch out and implement new distributions. 
  \item Syntax-highlighting-for-hakaru package for Sublime Text: this package makes developing Hakaru code much more convenient and streamlined (Mahmoud).
  \item Test case writing: we focus mainly on comprehensively testing only a select few distributions (e.g. chi-square).
\end{itemize}
        }

% Standard Library Development
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{block}{\Large{Standard Library Development}}
\justifying

\scriptsize{Accessibility means the standard library should implement commonly used probabilistic models. We have implemented the distributions described in the UDR chart, seen in part below. The following principles have guided the development of the standard library: 


\scriptsize{

\bigskip
\begin{itemize}
  \item Whenever possible, implement distributions as transformations on pre-existing models.
  \item Reference the UDR chart for possible ways to implement each distribution.
  \item In the case of multiple possible implementations, take the shortest possible path from a primitive distribution on the UDR.
\end{itemize}
        }
}

\centering
\includegraphics[height=12.5cm]{UDR.png}
\caption{\tiny{A snapshot of the UDR $^{[1]}$ shows how the normal distribution can be transformed into a multitude of other distributions.}}
\end{figure}

\scriptsize{Hakaru does not allow us to do algebraic operations on the PDF of a given distribution. The only operator we can use on a model is bind ({\tt \tiny{<$\sim$}}), to pull a sample and bind it to a variable (AKA a random variable). We are able to transform samples however we like. Therefore, we are interested in implementing transformations of the form:}

\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
& \tcboxmath[boxrule=2pt,colframe=MacMaroon]{R(p, q) \Rightarrow \textit{X} \sim A(p) \Rightarrow \textit{f(X)} \sim B(q)}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}

\bigskip

\scriptsize{\textit{p} and \textit{q} are sets of parameters on the distributions \textit{A}} and \textit{B}. \textit{R(p, q)} is a set of relationships between \textit{p} and \textit{q} that must be satisfied. \textit{f} is a transformation on the random variable \textit{X}. We can extend this definition to include transformations defined in terms of an aggregation of multiple independent samples. For example, the standard chi-square distribution is defined as the sum of the squares of \textit{n} normal random variables (see Figure 3). 

\bigskip
\scriptsize{Hakaru also lends itself well to Bayesian transformations where we want to pull a sample from a distribution which is parameterized with a value sampled from another distribution. These transformations take the following form. Here, we are saying that if \textit{X} is parameterized by \textit{p}, then the distribution \textit{C}, which is parameterized by \textit{p} and \textit{q}, is equal to another distribution, \textit{B}, which is parameterized by \textit{q} and \textit{X}. The gamma-poisson distribution can be described by such a transformation (see Figure 4).}

\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
& \tcboxmath[boxrule=2pt,colframe=MacMaroon]{X \sim A(p) \Rightarrow Y \sim B(q, X) = C(p, q)}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}

\scriptsize{Some distributions on the UDR are unreachable from Hakaru's primitive distributions using transformations like the 2 described above. In these cases, we have to implement the model in terms of the PMF for a discrete distribution or in terms of the PDF for a continuous distribution.}

\bigskip
\scriptsize{

A Python script has been developed that samples a large amount of data and plots the results in a histogram. This is a useful tool for gaining confidence in the correctness of our implementations. The plots shown below were created by sampling a Hakaru program 1,000,000 times.

% Testing Relationships Between Distributions
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{block}{\Large{Testing Relationships Between Distributions}}
\justifying

\scriptsize{When developing the standard library, the UDR chart often implied multiple possible implementations for a given distribution. We expect alternative implementations for the same distribution to result in equivalent probabilistic models. This line of thought is the basis for the kinds of test cases implemented. More generally, we have the following hypothesis.}

\bigskip

\scriptsize{Assume we know a proven relationship between 2 statistical distributions, A and B, which allows us to transform A and B into distributions that are equivalent to each other. Further assume this transformation takes on one of the forms discussed in the Standard Library Development section. We hypothesize that by applying the appropriate transformations to implementations of A and B, we can create two Hakaru programs whose {\tt \scriptsize{hk-maple}} outputs will be equivalent to each other. Test cases that prove our hypothesis true indicate the validity of the Hakaru language implementation. Test cases that prove our hypothesis false indicate an underlying bug in the language definition which is to be passed back to the language developers.
}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Conclusions & Future Work
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{block}{\Large{Conclusions \& Future Work}}

\scriptsize{This project was aimed at increasing language accessibility and testing the validity of Hakaru. A lot of ground was covered in both of these aspects in this project, but compared to other popular languages, Hakaru is still under development and has a lot of room for improvement. Here are just a few examples of where major development can still be done.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Languages features: Hakaru can be expanded further with new features like import statements and error/exception handling. 
    \item Standard library development: there are still many types of  distributions left to be implemented, such as multivariate distributions.
    \item Testing: There are a plethora of relationships between distributions that have yet to be investigated.
